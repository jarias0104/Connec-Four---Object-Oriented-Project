# Connec-Four---Object-Oriented-Project

Team Name: Bit by Bit

Team members: Jeshua Arias Santos, Tyler Le

Instructor: Mahbub Murshed

Main project: Program a Connect-four game in C#

Rules and tasks:

1. Connect 4 is a classic board game where two players (typically two different colors or two different symbols) take turns dropping disks (symbols) in a grid of 7 columns by 6 rows. The discs attract gravity and fall to the lowest empty space in their column (also rests on top of other pieces, if any). The winner of the game is the first to have 4 discs of their symbol/color in a row. This can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
2. Program Skeleton Development	Start developing an object-oriented program with your teammate to play the Connect Four game.
  
3. Prepare for the future	Throughout the project, you will need to address issues like bugs or new ideas when they are discovered.

4. Complete Core Classes	Hints: You should design at-least four classes (or more), along with any other classes needed to implement your project. You may have a controller class to play the game, a model class that implements intermediate steps and holds information about the game, two classes that extend the Player abstract class. One player can be a human player while the other can be a computer player. Both of these classes should communicate with the world via an object that is created in your controller class. You may also have a class that interacts and provides communication via text input from the keyboard and output on the Console.

5.	Complete Basic 2 User Game	Your primary focus is to complete the game for two human users. Once complete, you can start developing advanced logic for the human vs computer game.
6.	Make sure, OOP principles are followed	Most of the points will be allocated for understanding and implementing OOP principles, Therefore, before advancing your project further, make sure you have taken advantage of all OOP principles discussed in this course.
